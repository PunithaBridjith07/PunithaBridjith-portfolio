    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-700 mb-6">About Me</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">I am a self-motivated and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with practical experience in building dynamic and scalable web applications. I specialize in frontend development using <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Angular.js</strong> and backend systems powered by <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, with database management in <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>CouchDB</strong>.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I recently completed a <strong>6-month internship at Chain-Sys India Pvt Ltd</strong>, where I worked on real-time modules, integrated backend APIs, and improved UI features across various components. My previous internships have involved developing internal tools, working with RESTful services, and deploying applications with best practices.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">My projects reflect my passion for solving real-world problems through software — including a document scanner with a trial/subscription model, a smart note-taking application with integrated search, and a QR-based ticketing and validation system. These experiences have refined my ability to work independently and in collaborative environments.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I’m enthusiastic about continuous learning and am always ready to embrace new technologies, contribute to innovative solutions, and grow as a developer in fast-paced, evolving environments.</p>
